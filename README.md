# Dungeon_Gambit
Dungeon Gambit is a high-stakes, pick-up-and-play Pygame deck-builder and dungeon-crawler that doubles as a unique story generator.
 In this game, every run is a new narrative, starting with basic stats and a randomized 20-card themed deck. 
 Players must draw cards, manage consumable equipment for temporary defense, and strategically use hard-earned XP for powerful, run-specific Level Ups to survive.
 With a simple, mobile-friendly UI and a progressive difficulty curve where newly added monsters grow stronger.
 This game creates a new, self-contained heroic tale of triumph or defeat in every addictive, quick-fire session.
